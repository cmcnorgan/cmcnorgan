ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Chris McNorgan

I'm a machine learning researcher and neuroscientist with 20 years of experience developing computational models to explain and reverse-engineer how humans understand and learn about the world, and how this behavior interacts with language. 

Over the years, I've developed a number of machine learning models, with many of them implemented well before the current AI explosion and the proliferation of tools and libraries to make machine learning much more accessible. As a result, the source code for most of this work is written using some very niche C libraries used only by a handful of specialists, and is largely accessible only through algorithmic descriptions in my various scientific publications. I will endeavor to get some of my more recent work, written in Python, uploaded here.
